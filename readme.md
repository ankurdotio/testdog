## 🧪 Testing: `/api/v1/users/all`

We’ve written automated tests using **Jest** and **Supertest** for the `/api/v1/users/all` route.

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Local MongoDB instance running

---

### 🧾 Environment Setup

1. Copy the test environment config:
   ```bash
   cp .env.test.example .env.test

   Your .env.test.example file should look like:
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp-test
